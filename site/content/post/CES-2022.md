  Brewing with a Chemex probably seems like a complicated, time-consuming
  ordeal, but once you get used to the process, it becomes a soothing ritual
  that's worth the effort every time.

Welcome to 2022, I plan to do my best to publish articles on this site more often. First off, as with every year, let's start with CES. This year as you can see I'm doing it a little differently, this article will focus on (summarize) announcements that all the major tech companies made. I plan to also cover Samsung's announcements in a more detailed article (because I'm most knowledgeable in those topics) and also an article covering cool things from other exhibitors. Additionally, I plan to write a This Week In Tech article covering things from outside CES (if I have time).

### Sony
At CES this year Sony announced various things including the PlayStation VR 2. 

### Intel
During their keynote, Intel announced new CPUs, they are closer to being competitive with AMD. But the big announcement was Intel's first discrete GP U *Arc*. Arc will have X<sup>e</sup>SS Super Sampling and shared memory with integrated graphics in GPUs (like AMDs Smart Shift Max). Intel Arc GPUs will launch sometime this quarter (Q1 2022).

### AMD


### Asus


### Lenovo
At CES Lenovo announced their usual slate of spec upgrades. But they showed off some new products also, the ThinkPad Z Series which has Ryzen Pro 6000 chips and is made from recycled materials. But the big announcement was the dual-screen *ThinkBook Plus Gen 3*, unlike Asus's dual-screen laptops the 2<sup>nd</sup> screen is next to the keyboard not above it.

## Cars

### Mercedes Vision EQXX Concept Car Unveil

The EQXX looks really sleek and awesomely futuristic without looking stupid. Something that was mentioned in the presentation that I found really interesting was that they used a game engine (didn't mention which) to design the car. The first thing I thought when I saw the car was "Wow that's not a Tesla, that's what Tesla's should look like considering their futuristic MO".
