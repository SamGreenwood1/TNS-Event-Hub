This week Google held their I/O Developers Conference. At the conference they announced updated to Android, Search, Assistant, Pixel and, more.

## Minor Announcements from Sundar's Intro
Here are a bunch of things that Sundar Pichai (Google's CEO) mentioned in his opening address:
- Google Maps upgrades (20% more buildings worldwide), in Africa (300M buildings mapped) and 2X in India
- Immersive View coming to more cities
- Eco-friendly routing coming to Maps
- auto-generated YouTube chapters using DeepMind
- Google Docs getting automated TLDR; generation for long documents
- They're going to use tech from Starline (something they showed last year) to make meetings in Google Meet better quality

## Search
At I/O this year Google announced that they are upgrading a relatively new feature (that I didn't know about) called multisearch. This feature allows you to search with a picture than add text to be more detailed. The update allows you to specify that you're looking for things near you. They also showed off a new feature called "scene exploration", which allows you to search within a photo. Here's the example the give in their press release of when scene exploration can be used: 

> Imagine you’re trying to pick out the perfect candy bar for your friend who's a bit of a chocolate connoisseur. You know they love dark chocolate but dislike nuts, and you want to get them something of quality. With scene exploration, you’ll be able to scan the entire shelf with your phone’s camera and see helpful insights overlaid in front of you. 

## Android
This year Google announced a few update to Android, this year the updates are pretty minor. First off, the Google Pay app is being rebranded back to Google Wallet (which will gain support for Government/Student IDs and Disney Park passes). Also, earthquake alerts are being expanded to "many of the remaining high-risk regions around the world". They also demoed Android 12L which is the oncoming update to Android geared to tablets. 

### Upgrades

- The following apps are being brought to WearOS:
	- Spotify
	- adidas Running
	- LINE
	- KakaoTalk
	- SoundCloud
	- Deezer
- The following apps are getting updated to work better on tablets:
	- YouTube Music
	- Google Maps
	- Messages

	- and more
- Android (and Chrome) are getting virtual credit card

## Security
During the keynote there was a whole segment on privacy and security. The presenter announced that Google will now de-identify most of the data it collects and:
> We never sell your personal information to anyone or use the content you store in Gmail, Drive, or Maps for content marketing.

They also announced *My Ad Center* where you can control what ads you see on Google services (including YouTube). That includes opting in and out of selected categories. 

## Apps


## Google Assistant
One of the coolest (though I guess not as technologically complex) features that were shown off at the keynote was *Look & Talk*, which (on the Nest Hub Max) activates Google Assistant when you stare at it (with out saying the wake word). They also announced that more [*quick phrases*](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/9475056?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid#Complete%20tasks%20without%20saying%20%22Hey,%20Google%22) are coming. 

## Pixel
